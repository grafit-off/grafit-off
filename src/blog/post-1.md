## Let's get started!

First post using **Eleventy.js** + **njk**! When developing the site, I found a certain number of jambs in the layout, but there were quite a few of them, which is still pleasing.

Writing markup of the site took longer than expected, and all, because there was no design and everything, had to be invented on the fly. Roughly speaking, I did the design using HTML + SCSS and purely in my opinion. However, it turned out pretty well!

The "boarding" (if I may say so, in the case of using eleventy.js + njk) was pretty quick and simple. I especially liked the performance of the site, there is no need to access the database on the server as in conventional CMS, I think this is the main advantage of all static generators.


As a result:
- two weeks of design & layout development;
- three days "boarding" on eleventy using nunjucks;

And here it is, the site is working and ready to be replenished with new articles and works for the portfolio!
